### Interactive Calculus

#### Description
The main idea of our project is to create a interactive math app that helps individuals understand calculus. The purpose of this project is to allow the user to interact with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in a purely visual and geometric way, eliminating equations and allowing the user to build a geometrically intuitive understanding of the theorem. 

#### Getting started
This module requires the installation of scipy, numpy, OpenCV, and pygame. 
To install these in a linux system:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv

#### Usage
To use the program, run main.py.
Draw with you mouse by clicking and moving it across the screen. 
Draw with open cv by pressing space, moving a tennis ball in your hand, and pressing space again when you are done. 
After you are down drawing, a graph shows up with your input curve, it's derivative and integral.
