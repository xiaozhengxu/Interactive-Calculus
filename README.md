### Visual Calculus

#### Description
This project aims to help individuals understand and interact with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in a purely visual and geometric way. We hope to help learners build an intuition for the relationships among a line and its corresponding derivative and integral through an interactive window where users begin by drawing an input curve. Afer the curve is drawn, it's corresponding integral and derivative are displayed and users may adjust these lines and observe how they change in relation to one another. Users may also view corresponding tangent lines and areas to connect the functions of derivatives and integrals to their properties as lines. We hope this module will act as a supplement to traditional textbook explanations and will be a userful tool for both teachers and learners.

#### Getting started
This module requires scipy, numpy, OpenCV, and pygame. 

To install these in a linux system use:

 ` $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-opencv python-pygame`

To install these in other operating systems visit:

Pygame:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

OpenCV:
http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html#gsc.tab=0

Scipy and numpy:
http://www.numpy.org/

#### Usage
To use the program, run main.py.

Input:
Draw with you mouse by clicking and moving it across the screen. 
Draw with open cv by pressing space, moving an object of the open CV drawing color (displayed on the screen) in your hand, and pressing space again when you are done. 

Features:
Click and drag the curves to see how the derivative and integral change. 
Press 't' to see tangent lines. 
Press 'a' to see area under curve highlighted.
