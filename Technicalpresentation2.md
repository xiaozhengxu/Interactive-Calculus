### Technical Presentation 2 Preparation and Framing

#### March, Matthew, Judy

##### Background

The main idea of our project is to create a interactive math app that helps individuals understand calculus. We want to allow users to interact with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in a geometric and visual way. The project is implemented using the Model, View, Controller structure and the display is created using Pygame. The project also uses OpenCV to allow control through webcam. This program allows the user to draw an input line and then displays the line’s integral and derivative. After drawing the input, the user can adjust the line, exploring how the integral and derivative correspondingly change.

##### Key Questions

Currently our team has many ideas  which we want to implement, but a shortening time frame in which to do so. What we want out of this review session is a clear idea of which elements we should implement first and which should wait. We feel that an overview, code demonstration and the chance to download and run our code will provide sufficient background for this. We will provide a paper survey for feedback on which of the features we should implement. The features we want feedback on are as follows:

Built in tutorial / explanation of controls (beyond a README).

The ability to adjust the curve through “nudging” or magnetic pushing. Besides pulling points on the curve, the cursor becomes “magnetic” and you can “nudge” the curve around the screen. 

The ability to search for and find inflection points. When you hover over the correct location of an inflection point, a textbox or such will appear.

A command that will show you the location of inflection points.

A slider that will show relevant tangent lines and area under the curve as you slide it from left to right

The ability to use a rubix cube as a controller.

The ability to use any colors as a controller - i.e. the program will calibrate based on your chosen colors.

The ability to see a partially shaded out view of yourself in the pygame window as you draw input curves.

In addition, we would like to ask for feedback on calibrating OpenCV. While this question requires previous experience with OpenCV, we know that several of our peers are using it and may have implemented something similar. The final question we have is a UX question regarding clicking and dragging curves. This question does not require much technical explanation and will help us decide between two implementation methods.

##### Adenda
Our agenda is as follows:

Overview of our project: Refresher on our project goals and status, UML diagram and explanation of code structure

Demonstration of our code

Technical questions: Question about OpenCV color calibration, Question about adjusting drawn curves

Survey and feedback	

We will communicate with our audience in a couple ways. First, we will use slides as visual aids. Second, we will demonstrate our code on the projector, and interactively show how it works and what decisions we are facing. Finally we will ask our peers to download and play with our code, and fill out a short paper survey at the end.
